# Learning redis

As per definition, "Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store with persistence, used as a database, cache and message broker".
This repo helps you dive into the redis implementation, in your terminal. With this, you'll learn basic commands to read and write into an in-memory database.
Currently this has beginner level commands, but is aimed to be a full playground for redis.

Feel free to make mistakes, put in wrong commands and get to troubleshoot the errors.

Thanks.
